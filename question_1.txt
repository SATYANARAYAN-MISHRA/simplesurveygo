REST is used to build Web services that are lightweight,
maintainable, and scalable in nature. A service which is built on the REST architecture is called a RESTful service.
The underlying protocol for REST is HTTP, which is the basic web protocol.
 REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer

 Restful Methods:


POST â€“ This would be used to create a new employee using the RESTful web service
GET - This would be used to get a list of all employee using the RESTful web service
PUT - This would be used to update all employee using the RESTful web service
DELETE - This would be used to delete all employee using the RESTful web service


A RESTful web service (also called a RESTful web API) is a simple web service implemented using HTTP
and the principles of REST. Such a web service can be thought about as a collection of resources.
The definition of such a web service can be thought of as comprising three aspects:

SOAP services offer more out-of-the-box features,
the most important (imho, of course) of which is discovery.
The ability to add a reference to a SOAP service in just about any dev environment
and have it automatically generate a proxy class that will hide the underlying HTTP
complexities, even to the point of serializing non-trivial types, is very,very useful.

SOAP is a protocol. SOAP was designed with a specification.
It includes a WSDL file which has the required information on what the web service does in addition to the location of the web service.

REST is an Architectural style in which a web service can only be treated as a RESTful service if it follows the constraints of being
Client Server
Stateless
Cacheable
Layered System
Uniform Interface
